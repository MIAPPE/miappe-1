	<h2>MIAPPE</h2>
  <h4>Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment</h4>
	<p>MIAPPE is an open, community driven project to harmonize data from plant phenotyping experiments. MIAPPE comprises both a conceptual checklist of metadata required to adequately describe a plant phenotyping experiment, and software to validate, store and disseminate MIAPPE-compliant data.  We welcome contributions from anyone interested in plant phenotyping data.
	<p>Development of MIAPPE is an open process, so if you would like to do more than just comment, and to participate in the ongoing development, please let us know via <a href="mailto:miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk">miappe-feedback@ebi.ac.uk</a>.</p>

	<h3>Background</h3>

	<p>Plant phenotyping data is diverse, dispersed and increasingly plentiful owing to the application of new automated techniques.  While various initiatives have explored how to describe plant traits (e.g. the <a href="http://browser.planteome.org/amigo/term/TO:0000387#display-lineage-tab">Plant Trait Ontology</a>) and phenotypes, description of the experimental design that provides the context for phenotypic observations is not well-standardized.   A basic description of the materials used and the experiment performed is needed to support data discovery and data mining applications.  MIAPPE – the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment – is in development to address these needs.</p>
  <p>MIAPPE is a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n8/full/nbt.1411.html">Minimum Information (MI)</a> standard for plant phenotyping.  It defines a list of attributes that might be necessary to fully describe a phenotyping experiment, following <a href="http://fged.org/projects/miame/">the model originally established for microarray data</a>. Not all of the elements listed in an MI must be reported in each case. An MI document should rather be considered as a checklist, and consulted by a person describing or depositing the data to ensure the inclusion of all important data characteristics, i.e. what is meaningful for the interpretation and potential replication of the research.</p>
 
<p>MIAPPE is a logical standard - but there are specific implementations of tools designed to support its use and application, for example, in the <a hef="http://isa-tools.org">ISA-tools</a> framework. We are working with the developers of the <a href="http://www.brapi.org">Plant Breeding API</a> (BRAPI) to ensure the compliance of BRAPI with the MIAPPE standard, and to coordinate future developments.</p>
 <p>MIAPPE was originally been developed in the context of the transPLANT, European Plant Phenotyping Network and ELIXIR-EXCELERATE projects, but we are keen to work with anyone interested in contributing to, reviewing or using the standard, or developing new tools.<p>
