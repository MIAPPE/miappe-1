  <h4>Minimum Information about A Plant Phenotyping Experiment</h4>
	<p>Plant phenotyping data is diverse, dispersed and increasingly plentiful owing to the application of new automated techniques.  While various initiatives have explored how to describe plant traits (e.g. the <a href="http://browser.planteome.org/amigo/term/TO:0000387#display-lineage-tab">Plant Trait Ontology</a>) and phenotypes, description of the experimental design that provides the context for phenotypic observations is not well-standardized.   A basic description of the materials used and the experiment performed is needed to support data discovery and data mining applications.  MIAPPE – the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment – is in development to address these needs.</p>

  <p>A <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/mibbi-minimum-information-biological-and-biomedical-investigations">Minimum Information</a> (MI) document is a list of attributes that might be necessary to fully describe a phenotyping experiment, following the model originally established for microarray data. Not all of the elements listed in MI must be reported in each case – it is up to the researcher to decide what is meaningful to interpretation of the results and potential replication of the research. A Minimum Information document should rather be considered as a checklist, and consulted by a person describing or depositing the data in order to include all the important data characteristics.</p>
