	<p>Plant phenotyping data is diverse, dispersed and increasingly plentiful owing to the application of new automated techniques.  While various initiatives have explored how to describe plant traits (e.g. the Plant Trait Ontology) and phenotypes, description of the experimental design that provides the context for phenotypic observations is not well-standardized.   A basic description of the materials used and the experiment performed is needed to support data discovery and data mining applications.  MIAPPE – the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment – is in development to address these needs.</p>

  <p>A Minimum Information (MI) document is a list of attributes that might be necessary to fully describe a phenotyping experiment, following the model originally established for microarray data. Not all of the elements listed in MI must be reported in each case – it is up to the researcher to decide what is meaningful to interpretation of the results and potential replication of the research. A Minimum Information document should rather be considered as a checklist, and consulted by a person describing or depositing the data in order to include all the important data characteristics.</p>
